# Kotlin Features Research: Enforced Named Argument Form and Argument Labels

This repository is dedicated for my (Mark Ipatov) project, done as a bachelors thesis, regarding the benefits, use and implementation details of two features: *Enforced Named Argument Form* and _Argument Labels_.

Current work on the documents is in progress. Aggregation and structuring of existing information from other documents is being done.

## Structure of the repository

As these features are heavily interconnected, general motivation for their introduction is described in the [generalReasons.md] file. Glossary for both proposals is specified in the [glossary.md] file.

More specific information regarding the features, discussions and existing prototypes is placed in their corresponding directories:

* Enforced Named Argument Form: [EnforcedNamedForm/]
    * Main document: [EnforcedNamedForm/main.md]
* Argument Labels: [ArgumentLabels/]
    * Main document: [ArgumentLabels/]
