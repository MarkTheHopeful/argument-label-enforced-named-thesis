# Kotlin Features Research: Enforced Named Argument Form and Argument Labels

This repository is dedicated for my (Mark Ipatov) project, done as a bachelors thesis, regarding the benefits, use and implementation details of two features: **Enforced Named Argument Form** and **Argument Labels**.

Current work on the documents is in progress. Aggregation and structuring of existing information from other documents is being done.

## Structure of the repository

As these features are heavily interconnected, basic descriptions for them and general reasons to implement them are presented in the [introduction.md](introduction) file. Glossary for both proposals is specified in the [glossary.md](glossary) file.

More specific information regarding the features, discussions and existing prototypes is placed in their corresponding directories:

* Enforced Named Argument Form: [EnforcedNamedForm/](Directory)
    * [EnforcedNamedForm/main.md](Main document)
* Argument Labels: [ArgumentLabels/](Directory)
    * [ArgumentLabels/main.md](Main document)
